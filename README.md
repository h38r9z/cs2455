CASE STUDY   2 -   Upland   Restaurant Case
Valuing   Mutually   Exclusive Capital   Projects
InstructionsThis case study will ask you to   evaluate   mutually   exclusive   investment   opportunities   by   putting yourself   in the   shoes of two recent graduates turned   restaurant owners and investors. After   reading the   background scenario   carefully,   you   will   have   to   answer   a   series   of   preparatory   questions   and   write   an   executive   summary.   The   questions   are   meant to guide you to   prepare   the   executive   summary.   You   are   free   (and   encouraged)   to   work   on additional analyses to   make your executive   summary   stronger.You will   have to   upload a   single   pdf   document   containing   1) the   one-page   executive   summary,   2)   answers to   the    preparatory    questions,    and    3)    all    the    tables    and    appendices    backing      up    your    analysis,      including      any   additional work you think is   helpful.Note that points will be awarded for presentation. This includes the ease with which one can understand your   work,   whether   your   final    document    is    nicely    formatted,    whether    tables    and    exhibits    are    clear    and    well-   documented,   etc. You   may want to think   of   your   report   as   something   you   would   feel   comfortable   handing   in   to your   boss   if you were a financial   analyst.
You may work in groups of up to four students, in which case you only needto submit one report. Please make   sure   to include   the names and student IDs of all students in   the   file. Working in groups is highly recommended.
BackgroundAfter   graduating   from    UCI    2   years   ago,   you   and   three   friends   decided   to   start    Upland    Restaurant.       After   searching for several months for a location in Irvine, you decided togo a different   route and   buy   5   acres   of   land   including an old restaurant and a small building, formerly used for offices, at   the edge of   town.   After renovating   the   old   restaurant,   you   were   able   to   open   and   grow   sales   over   the   past   2   years.      However,   lacking the   initial   capital, you   never   did   anything   with the   other   smaller   building.       Now that you   have   saved   up   some   cash, you   and   your   friends   feel   like   you   can   generate   some   extra   income   from   the   existing   building.      To   that   end,   you   and   your   team    have    paid   $20,000   to   a   consulting   firm   for   a   forecast   of   the   future    revenues   and   costs   associated with the different   options you are considering.   The   exhibits   given   below   are   the   outcome   of the   consulting   firm’sresearch.Your   first option is   to enter a leasing agreement with a   former   Anteater   who runs an event planning company   called   Diamond   Events.      After   describing   the   location   and   space   to   her,   she   is   interested   in   renting   it   out   to   host   a variety   of   events. To   make this   possible, you will   have   to   renovate   the   space   first,   which   will   take   time   and   money.   Additionally, if Diamond   Events were to lease the space, you and your team   expect there to   bean   increase   in   repairs,   maintenance,   and   utilities   as   well   as   a   slight   decrease   in   restaurant   sales   from   an   overall   decrease   in   ambience   from the   additional   event   goers   (loud   partyers,   congested   parking   lot,   etc.).       Diamond   Events is willing to sign a 4-year lease with an annual rent of $84,000 in the first year, growing at 5% thereafter.   The team’s additional assumptions are given below in Exhibit 1; where the renovation cost   is a   one-time   capital   expenditure and the   increase   in   repairs,   maintenance, and   utilities,   is an annual   cost.
Note: All operating income are taxable, therefore operating expenses reduce the taxable   income, while   capital   expenditures such as   renovation costs and   equipment   costs   are   not tax   deductible.

$                300,000
$                310,000The other option the team is considering is starting a small craft brewery in the space.    While the renovations   would   be   much   less   expensive,   in   order   to   start   the   brewery,   your   team   would   need   to   buy   and   install   the   required   equipment.       Additionally,    there   would    be    other    increases    in   costs   to   consider.       A    major    benefit,   however,   is that   the   brewery   would   serve   as   a   complement   to   your   existing   restaurant   business.      Your   team   feels   that offering   your own unique craft beers will lead   to more food sales   than would otherwise occur without   them.   You project that your craft   beverage sales will start at $85,000   in year   1 and   grow   at   7.5%   annually   after   that.   Additional assumptions are found below in Exhibit 3; where the renovation and equipment costs are one-
time capital expenditures and the   increase   in   repairs,   maintenance, and   utilities,   is   an   annual   cost.   Note: The   equipment   is   assumed   not   to   depreciate   overtime.

   Lastly, your team   needs to consider what you can do with the craft   brewery   after   the   project   life   is   over.   After   brainstorming, you feel   that there are 2 possible outcomes after the 6 years are up. The first outcome, outcome   A,   is that the   project   does   not   go   as   planned,   in which   case you will   have   no   other   option   than   simply   ceasing   operations. The   second   outcome,   outcome   B,   is that the   project   goes well, you   develop   a   good   menu   of   craft   beverages   and   a   steady   customer   base.   In this   case,   you   believe   that   you   will   have   two   options   after   Year   6.   The first   option,   option   B.1.,   is for   an   outside   investor to   purchase the craft   brewery   portion   of your   business.


The   second   option,   option   B.2.,   is   to   simply   continue   operations,   which   you   will   value   as   a   perpetuity.      The   necessary assumptions are given   below   in   Exhibit 4.
Exhibit 4: Terminal Options
Outcome   A   - Cease   Operations
Outcome   B, Option   1 - Sell   to   Investor
Outcome   B, Option   2 -   Continue Operations
Project ends after   6th    year.      No   future cash flows.
Sell craft   brewery operations to   an outside   investor for   an   estimated $600,000 at the   end   of   the 6th    year.    Capital gains tax   rate   is   15%.Continue operations   indefinitely   after the 6th    year.    Net   operating   profits after taxes   is expected   to   grow   1.5% annually.For outcome   B, your team   is   unsure about what the   best option   is   and   is   hoping   you   can   help   them   determine   which one would add the   most value to the   business.    Additionally, from   your   time   in   business   school,   you   are   aware   that   valuation   techniques   are   very   sensitive   to   the   assumptions   that   are   made.      While   you   and   your   team worked very   hard   on projecting sales, growth rates, etc., you understand that these are just expectations   and that actual values can   be   higher or   lower, impacting the attractiveness of the options.    Therefore,   it will   be   important to conduct sensitive analyses on   some   of the   key   parameters.
Preparatory   Questions
1)            Lease   option

3)          Assuming the worst   outcome for the   craft   brewery   project   (outcome A),   which   option   should   Upland   choose:   do   nothing,   lease to   Diamond event,   or   open craft   brewery? Why?
4)          Assuming   a   good   outcome for   the   craft   brewery   (outcome   B), which   of the two   options   (B.1.   or   B.2.)   offers   most value?
Executive SummaryPrepare   a   short   (less   than   1   page)   executive   summary   that   lays   out   major   assumptions   you   used   and   what   decision you   have   arrived   at:   should you go   ahead with   the   leasing   option,   the   craft   brewery   option,   or   leave   the small   building   idle?
